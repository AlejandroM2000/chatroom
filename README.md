# ChatRoom project purposes

### For this project I will want to create a chat room like CLI where two users will be able to send messages to each otehr when there is a server in the middle, where the "server" will be my computer

# What do I plan to learn
- HTTP
- TCP/IP
- security protocols

# General Outline
I want to make a server where it will receive messages from all clients that are present in the chatroom
- server will be designated by who is running the app ie localhost: 8080
- for client to connect, they will need to know the port number they are connecting to 
- figure out if this is safe, if not, make it safe
